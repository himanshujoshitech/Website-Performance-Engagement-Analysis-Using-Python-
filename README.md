## 🚀 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **website performance and user engagement** using Python.  
The goal is to understand **traffic behavior, engagement quality, channel performance, and time-based trends** through data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and visualization.

This is an **applied exploratory data analysis (EDA)** project with real-world, business-focused insights.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze website traffic across different channel groups  
- Understand user behavior using **sessions** and **engagement rate**  
- Compare **engaged vs non-engaged sessions**  
- Perform **time-based (hourly) analysis**  
- Visualize trends using Python libraries  
- Derive **actionable business insights**

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- 🐍 Python  
- 📦 Pandas  
- 🔢 NumPy  
- 📊 Matplotlib  
- 🎨 Seaborn

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
The following steps were performed before analysis:

- Standardized column headers  
- Removed redundant header rows  
- Converted `DateHour` to datetime format  
- Converted numeric columns using safe type coercion  
- Handled missing and invalid values  
- Extracted `Hour` feature for time-based analysis  
- Created **Non-Engaged Sessions** feature  

---

## 🧠 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed to understand:
- Distribution of sessions and engagement  
- Channel-wise performance  
- Time-based traffic patterns  
- Variability and outliers in engagement rate

## 📌 Key Findings
- High traffic does not always imply high engagement  
- Some channels generate fewer sessions but higher engagement quality  
- Engagement varies significantly across hours  
- A noticeable portion of sessions are non-engaged  
- Time-based and channel-based analysis reveals optimization opportunities  

---

## 💡 Business Insights & Recommendations
- Focus marketing efforts on **high-engagement channels**, not just high traffic  
- Optimize landing pages for channels with high non-engaged sessions  
- Schedule campaigns during **peak engagement hours**  
- Use engagement metrics to improve user experience and retention  

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how Python can be used for **real-world website analytics**.  
By combining data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory analysis, and visualization, meaningful insights were derived from raw website data.
